# Medical Disease Classification Project

## üìä Project Overview
This project implements various machine learning models to predict medical conditions, with a focus on achieving high recall for disease detection. The project compares different classification algorithms to find the optimal approach for medical diagnosis.

## üéØ Objective
To develop a reliable classification system that:
- Maximizes the detection of positive cases (high recall)
- Maintains acceptable precision
- Provides interpretable results for medical staff

## üìà Models Evaluated
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- AdaBoost
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)
- Logistic Regression
- Stacking Ensemble
